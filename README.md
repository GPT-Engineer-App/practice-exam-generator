# practice-exam-generator

I do know some python, and would like to create a small project where I have a website in which users can input their university name and course code, alongside a list of topics that will be tested, and the output would be a practice exam based on the list of topics that have been entered. There should also be a space for students to enter their answers, and another space for them to receive feedback as well as a button which then appears where the students are shown their final score as a sort of pop up. To do this generation, I would like to use the openai api in order to use GPT-3.5 turbo and have the generated text/practice exam pasted to the webpage. Given this, I would like to ensure the languages I use are supported by the api. 

The layout of the webpage should be modern, chic and with mostly neutral colours with a bit of accent colours to allow certain important buttons to pop out.
